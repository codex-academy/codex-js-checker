# Option 1: Beginner - install for each project

Copy the `package.json` [from the repo](https://github.com/codex-academy/codex-js-checker/blob/gh-pages/package.json) to your project.

Run `npm install`.

Now run

```
npm run check
```

to (run the "check" script and) have your JavaScript files watched for changes and checked for errors and readability. To stop the checker, hit `Ctrl + C`.
